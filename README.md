# Not_A_Malware

Well, well, well. Not_A_Malware, is essentially a malware, that uses a backdoor, containg a keylogger, persistence, and many such tools.
This backdoor works exceptionally on latest Windows 10, without getting detected by the Microsoft Defender. This does works on Windows 11, but output varies system to system.
